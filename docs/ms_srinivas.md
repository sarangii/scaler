Hi Srinivas! 

Aditya here. 

I thought of creating this page to bring you upto speed with background and context so that we are more efficient in our session. 

Here's a brief snippet of** my background** and how I enrolled in Scaler. 

I got introduced to computer programming very early  at school. I was programming till the basic level (using functions, doing advanced kind of loops) till 10th grade. Computers, and making them do complicated tasks sparked joy in me. 

At this juncture I changed tracks to being an arts background student. But never lost the itch to develop skills in programming. I was introduced to Linux, and since the last 7 years never changed to any other OS. 

At the backburner there had been always a desire to work in the IT industry. 

I enjoy the dopamine hit that you get when make your code function. 

Currently, I work in a Non-profit, which works with the government to optimise the processes within the government to deliver welfare schemes. 

In the medium term I would like to work at growth stage start-up.

Currently I am in the beginner level track at the Scaler Course.  

Here are the questions I have: 

- What is the right kind of expectation to have from the program? 

- Will my unconventional background be a barrier in getting jobs? 

- Does being precocious and learn additional things on the side harm you?  

- Does having a grasp over computer science fundamentals necessary? 

- What are the some of the pitfalls to avoid in the journey? 

- What has been some of the things which drain you in your software engineering job?
